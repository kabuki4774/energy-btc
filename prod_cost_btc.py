# Probabilistic Framework & Investment Thesis
# -------------------------
st.header("Investment Thesis & Probabilistic Framework")
st.markdown(
    """
    Investment thesis integrates the following key components:
    
    1. **Scarcity & Supply Dynamics:**  
       - The total BTC supply is capped at 21 million with diminishing new issuance due to halving events.  
       - With over 93% of BTC mined and the 2024 halving cutting rewards to 3.125 BTC, scarcity is intensifying.
    
    2. **Mining Economics as a Price Floor:**  
       - The network’s production cost (driven by hash rate, ASIC efficiency, and electricity costs) establishes a fundamental floor below which price cannot sustainably fall.  
       - If BTC price falls significantly below this floor, miner capitulation is likely, reducing supply and eventually supporting a price rebound.
    
    3. **Network Security & Hash Rate:**  
       - An ever-increasing hash rate (now nearing record EH/s levels) reinforces network security and implies robust miner confidence.  
       - Difficulty adjusts to maintain consistent block times; rising difficulty means higher production costs over time.
    
    4. **Technological & Energy Trends:**  
       - ASIC efficiency improvements (although maturing) and the steady availability of low-cost power (often sourced from renewables) are key to sustaining mining profitability.  
       - Competition from the AI boom for chips might slightly constrain hardware availability, but miners are actively adapting.
    
    5. **Macroeconomic & Adoption Drivers:**  
       - Growing institutional acceptance, a hedge against inflation, and potential macro pivots (e.g. easing policies) further drive Bitcoin’s value.
    
    **Probabilistic Outcome Scenarios:**  
    Based on this framework, we envision three outcome scenarios for Bitcoin’s price:
    
    | Scenario        | Short-Term (1–2 Years)                                  | Long-Term (2030)                                  |
    |-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
    | **Conservative**| Minor correction toward the production cost floor (e.g. 10–30% dip)  | \$80k – \$120k – modest appreciation driven by supply constraints |
    | **Baseline**    | Cyclical volatility with price staying above mining costs           | \$150k – \$250k – steady growth aligned with network fundamentals |
    | **Optimistic**  | Robust demand with temporary euphoria driving higher multiples         | \$300k – \$500k+ – widespread adoption and “digital gold” dynamics |
    
    These scenarios are underpinned by the interplay of mining economics and broader macro factors. Investors should monitor:
    
      - **Network Hash Rate & Difficulty:** Higher values indicate rising production costs and increased security.
      - **ASIC Efficiency & Electricity Costs:** They determine the baseline cost of production.
      - **Institutional Adoption & Macro Trends:** They influence demand and the eventual market premium above production costs.
    
    **Guidance:**  
    Use the controls above to adjust assumptions and see how production cost evolves. Compare that “floor” to current market prices and consider the probabilistic outcomes when evaluating your investment horizon.
